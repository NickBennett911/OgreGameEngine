# OgreGameEngine
Game engine that I made in a class at SSU going above and beyond whenever possible

All the dependencies lie within the dependencies. Make sure to include them all approprately in whatever work environment you choose to try the project out in.

Some of the features the game engine does (in the foreground and background):
  Ogre Graphical Rendering
  Singletons
  OOP
  Custom Scripting
  Custom Game Objects
  Object Managers
  Custom Physics Integration 
  Collision Integration
  Scene Parsing
  Custom Component System
  Logging
  Input Bindings
  
 Once you get everything built and running you will get a little taste of what some of the engine can do with the little space invaders demonstration. This is contained within the
 bin/media/invader_media/ folder. There you will find the custom python scripts that the game is running off of as well as the meshes, materials and the scene file for the space
 invaders. 
 
 To add more scripts:
 - nav to bin/media/init.py
 - add more scripts the same way as is done in that file
 The engine intializes the scripting by running that python file.
